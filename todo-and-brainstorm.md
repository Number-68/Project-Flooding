# todo
- [ ] build first website
      

---

# Brainstorm
- [ ] portfolio: browser in a browser; A real browser, not immitation.
- [ ] website visitor counter diy. can separate between real visitor and scraper with user agent or something
- [ ] think of purpose of this website; i'm thinking that this is made to show good dev practices. That said, I need to mention in the README that I am purposefully writing code with the notion of proper thought to tech debt. making sure to test components and make sure that things are simple and clean for scalability. the goal of everything in this portfolio is to display my skills of simplicity and scalability etc. showing good dev practices. even if it's as simple as making a bare frontend focused framework type portfolio website.
